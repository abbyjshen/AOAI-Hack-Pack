## Considerations
### What is a Copilot
How much of the Copilot stack are you intending to cover in your own Copilot?

[The era of the AI Copilot | KEY02H - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyY0fEO5jVY)

AI-enabled app continuum
1. Reason over existing data
2. Automate actions
3. Act on users' behalf <-- Copilot

### Considerations
Have you thought about:

- APIs or programmatice access to functionality in your app in order to act on users' behalf?
  - If you are building and exposing actions in your app as a plugin, this is built on OpenAI's plugins specification (so can be invoked by ChatGPT, Bing Chat, M365 copilot, and others). You may want to build your plugin, then test it with M365 or other existing Copilots first https://aka.ms/AOAI-Hack-build-plugin
  - e.g., Microsoft has an existing automation framework VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), which is a programming language for automating tasks in Office applications

- UX - does user invoke it via a chatbot? text field? ...or a button? Do you pass user natural language input directly, or formulate a prompt based on restrained input? How do you expose what your Copilot does/doesn't do? 

- Safety and guardrails when acting on users' behalf? What if the detected intent based on user prompt is unclear or incorrect or unsupported?
